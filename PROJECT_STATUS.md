## 🚀 **MAJOR UPGRADE: Real Audio Metering**

### **Problem Solved:**

- ❌ **expo-audio**: No real audio level access (simulated levels)
- ❌ **expo-av**: Deprecated, limited functionality
- ✅ **react-native-audio-recorder-player**: Real audio metering with `currentMetering`

### **Key Improvements:**

```typescript
// REAL audio levels from native microphone
this.audioRecorderPlayer.addRecordBackListener((e: any) => {
  const audioLevel = Math.min(1, (e.currentMetering || 0) / 100);
  const isWhisper = audioLevel <= this.whisperThreshold;
  // Now we get ACTUAL microphone levels!
});
```

### **Technical Benefits:**

- **Native Implementation**: Better performance and reliability
- **Real-time Metering**: 100ms update intervals for responsive feedback
- **Accurate Whisper Detection**: Based on actual audio levels, not simulation
- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently on iOS and Android

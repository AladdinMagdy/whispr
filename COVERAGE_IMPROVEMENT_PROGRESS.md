## **🔧 Technical Patterns Established**

### **Successful Mocking Pattern:**

```typescript
// Mock all dependencies before importing the service
jest.mock("../services/dependencyService", () => ({
  getDependencyService: jest.fn(),
}));

// In beforeEach, setup mocks
const { getDependencyService } = jest.requireMock(
  "../services/dependencyService"
);
getDependencyService.mockReturnValue(mockDependencyService);
```

### **Repository Pattern Testing:**

```typescript
// Create mock repository
const mockRepository = {
  save: jest.fn(),
  getWithFilters: jest.fn(),
  // ... other methods
};

// Create service with mock repository
const service = new ServiceClass(mockRepository);
```

### **Error Testing Pattern:**

```typescript
it("should handle repository errors", async () => {
  mockRepository.method.mockRejectedValue(new Error("Database error"));

  await expect(service.method()).rejects.toThrow("Expected error message");
});
```

### **Enum Coverage Pattern:**

```typescript
// Test all enum values
const categories = Object.values(ReportCategory);
categories.forEach((category) => {
  const result = service.method(category);
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```

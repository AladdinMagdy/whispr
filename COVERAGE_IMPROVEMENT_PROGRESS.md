## **🔧 Technical Patterns Established**

### **Successful Firebase Mocking Pattern:**

```typescript
// Mock the firebase config
jest.mock("../../config/firebase", () => ({
  getFirestoreInstance: jest.fn(() => ({})),
}));

// Mock firebase/firestore with firebase-mock
jest.mock("firebase/firestore", () => {
  const mockFirestore = {
    collection: jest.fn(),
    doc: jest.fn(),
    getDoc: jest.fn(),
    getDocs: jest.fn(),
    updateDoc: jest.fn(),
    deleteDoc: jest.fn(),
    query: jest.fn(),
    where: jest.fn(),
    orderBy: jest.fn(),
    limit: jest.fn(),
    Timestamp: {
      fromDate: jest.fn((date) => ({
        toDate: () => date,
        seconds: Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000),
        nanoseconds: (date.getTime() % 1000) * 1000000,
      })),
    },
  };

  return mockFirestore;
});
```

### **Safe Error Handling Pattern:**

```typescript
// Instead of: error instanceof Error
// Use: error && typeof error === 'object' && 'message' in error
throw new Error(
  `Failed to save user reputation: ${
    error && typeof error === "object" && "message" in error
      ? error.message
      : "Unknown error"
  }`
);
```

### **Safe Timestamp Handling Pattern:**

```typescript
// Instead of: data.createdAt instanceof Timestamp
// Use: data.createdAt && typeof data.createdAt === 'object' && 'toDate' in data.createdAt
createdAt:
  data.createdAt && typeof data.createdAt === 'object' && 'toDate' in data.createdAt
    ? (data.createdAt as { toDate: () => Date }).toDate()
    : data.createdAt,
```

### **Repository Implementation Testing:**

```typescript
describe("FirebaseRepository", () => {
  let repository: FirebaseRepository;
  let mockFirestore: any;

  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    repository = new FirebaseRepository();

    const { getFirestoreInstance } = jest.requireMock("../../config/firebase");
    mockFirestore = getFirestoreInstance();
  });

  // Test CRUD operations, error handling, and edge cases
});
```

// Mock the firebase config
jest.mock("../../config/firebase", () => ({
  getFirestoreInstance: jest.fn(() => ({})),
}));

// Mock firebase/firestore with firebase-mock
jest.mock("firebase/firestore", () => {
  const mockFirestore = {
    collection: jest.fn(),
    doc: jest.fn(),
    getDoc: jest.fn(),
    getDocs: jest.fn(),
    updateDoc: jest.fn(),
    deleteDoc: jest.fn(),
    query: jest.fn(),
    where: jest.fn(),
    orderBy: jest.fn(),
    limit: jest.fn(),
    Timestamp: {
      fromDate: jest.fn((date) => ({
        toDate: () => date,
        seconds: Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000),
        nanoseconds: (date.getTime() % 1000) * 1000000,
      })),
    },
  };

  return mockFirestore;
});
```

### **Safe Error Handling Pattern:**

```typescript
// Instead of: error instanceof Error
// Use: error && typeof error === 'object' && 'message' in error
throw new Error(
  `Failed to save user reputation: ${
    error && typeof error === "object" && "message" in error
      ? error.message
      : "Unknown error"
  }`
);
```

### **Safe Timestamp Handling Pattern:**

```typescript
// Instead of: data.createdAt instanceof Timestamp
// Use: data.createdAt && typeof data.createdAt === 'object' && 'toDate' in data.createdAt
createdAt:
  data.createdAt && typeof data.createdAt === 'object' && 'toDate' in data.createdAt
    ? (data.createdAt as { toDate: () => Date }).toDate()
    : data.createdAt,
```

### **Repository Implementation Testing:**

```typescript
describe("FirebaseRepository", () => {
  let repository: FirebaseRepository;
  let mockFirestore: any;

  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    repository = new FirebaseRepository();

    const { getFirestoreInstance } = jest.requireMock("../../config/firebase");
    mockFirestore = getFirestoreInstance();
  });

  // Test CRUD operations, error handling, and edge cases
});
```

## **Technical Guidelines**

### **Mocking Strategy**

1. **Repository Pattern Services**: Mock repository interfaces ✅
2. **Firebase Implementations**: Mock Firestore SDK with comprehensive mocking 🔄
3. **External APIs**: Mock HTTP responses and error scenarios ⏳
4. **Firestore**: Use comprehensive mocking for SDK functions 🔄

### **Test Structure**

1. **Static Methods**: Test first, easier to mock ✅
2. **Instance Methods**: Test after static methods are covered ✅
3. **Error Handling**: Test all error scenarios ✅
4. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions ✅
5. **Integration**: Test service interactions ⏳

### **Coverage Targets**

- **Statement Coverage**: 80%+ (minimum) 🔄 (70.86% current)
- **Branch Coverage**: 70%+ (target) 🔄 (66.87% current)
- **Function Coverage**: 85%+ (target) 🔄 (70.18% current)
- **Line Coverage**: 80%+ (minimum) 🔄 (71.45% current)

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Identified Risks**

1. **Complex Mocking**: Firestore SDK mocking is challenging 🔄
2. **External Dependencies**: API services require extensive mocking ⏳
3. **Singleton Complexity**: Instance method testing is difficult ✅
4. **Time Constraints**: Comprehensive testing takes time

### **Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with repository pattern services ✅
2. **Incremental Approach**: Build complexity gradually ✅
3. **Focus on Static Methods**: Achieve coverage with simpler tests ✅
4. **Document Patterns**: Create reusable mocking patterns ✅
